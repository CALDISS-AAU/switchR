```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
ess18 <- read_csv('https://github.com/CALDISS-AAU/workshop_R-intro/raw/master/data/ESS2018DK_subset.csv')
```

## Filtering and subsetting

R supports filtering and subsetting from "base" operations but there are packages with more intuitive functions (like the packages in tidyverse: <https://www.tidyverse.org/>).

### Compare and contrast

These two commands achieve the same result. Which is more intuitive?

```{r}
subset <- ess18[ess18$gndr == 'Male', c('gndr', 'prtvtddk')]
head(subset)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
subset <- ess18 %>%
    filter(gndr == 'Male') %>%
    select('gndr', 'prtvtddk')
head(subset)
```
